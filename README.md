# Nextflow-RNA-Seq-Pipeline
Automated RNA Seq Analysis Pipeline
- This pipeline automates the process of RNA-seq analysis by performing several steps such as trimming, alignment, quantification, and summarizing the results.


## Prerequisites
Docker
Nextflow

## Installation
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/RNA-seq-pipeline.git\ Build the Docker image: docker build -t rna-seq-pipeline .
Make sure to adjust the paths and parameters in the config file to match your specific pipeline and system.

## Usage
To run the pipeline, use the following command:
nextflow run rnaseq_script.nf -c nextflow.config
This command runs the rnaseq_script.nf script with the options specified in the nextflow.config file

## Output
The pipeline generates several output files, including:

-Trimmed fastq files
-Fastqc reports of the trimmed reads
-Aligned bam files
-Tab-separated gene counts
-MultiQC report
The output files are located in the directory specified in the config file.

## Dependencies
The pipeline uses the following tools and libraries:

-Trimmomatic
-FastQC
-STAR aligner
-FeatureCounts
-MultiQC
All dependencies are included in the Docker image.
